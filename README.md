# Count
This is a class which counts in ascending order from zero, but it keeps every digit as a separate entry in a list. This allows you to specify an integer base to count in. This is the most important class which drives the other classes.

## Enrep
Stands for `n-repetitions` which takes a string of characters and and repeats them in every permutation possible and returns a list of them all. You are free to change the length of the output and interestingly you can set the list to grow up to a specified length. This class is specially useful for making word lists for cracking hashes.
